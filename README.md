# MGS3 Audio Converter
  Tool enables the conversion of the game's unique audio formats to standard WAV files and vice versa.
  
## Features
- **Convert MGS3 Audio to WAV/PCM DATA**: Transform the game's unique audio formats into widely-used WAV files for easy editing and listening on standard audio players. (Only MTAF format is supported at this time, more to come)
- **Parses MTAF correctly**: It can correctly tell you thru print statements a breakdown of MTAF format.

## Current Status: Under Development
 **Important Note**: This tool is currently in development. Converting MTAF to Wav works but not the other way around yet.
 
## To Do
1. **Fix MTAF to WAV Conversion**: The conversion process is complete! 2025 Update, will update code later
2. **Support VAG Files and Other MGS3 Audio Formats**: Expand the tool's capabilities to handle VAG files and additional audio formats used in MGS3.
3. **Implement Reimport Features**: Develop functionality to allow users to reimport edited audio back into the game  (WIP having issues)
4. **SDT Container Support**: Plan to support SDT containers in a future update (to be tackled later).
