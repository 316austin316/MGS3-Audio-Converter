# MGS3 Audio Converter
  Tool enables the conversion of the game's unique audio formats to standard WAV files and vice versa.
  
## Features
- **Convert MGS3 Audio to WAV/PCM DATA**: Transform the game's unique audio formats into widely-used WAV files for easy editing and listening on standard audio players. (Only MTAF format is supported at this time, more to come)
- **Parses MTAF correctly**: It can correctly tell you thru print statements a breakdown of MTAF format.

## Current Status: Under Development
 **Important Note**: This tool is currently in development and is not fully functional. I am actively working on resolving issues to make the conversion process smooth and reliable.
 
## To Do
1. **Fix MTAF to WAV Conversion**: The conversion process is almost complete, but requires additional work. The challenge lies in translating C code into Python, which is proving to be a complex task.
2. **Support VAG Files and Other MGS3 Audio Formats**: Expand the tool's capabilities to handle VAG files and additional audio formats used in MGS3.
3. **Implement Reimport Features**: Develop functionality to allow users to reimport edited audio back into the game.
4. **SDT Container Support**: Plan to support SDT containers in a future update (to be tackled later).

## Contribution
I welcome contributions from the community. If you have experience in audio programming or are familiar with the MGS3 audio formats, your input can be invaluable in improving this tool.
